This is the frontend for the Dragalia Lost dragon optimization project.

It's mostly just a UI bootstrapped with CRA, so there's nothing interesting behind it.
For more information on CRA see the React documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.
For more information on this project see https://dldragonopt.app/ or https://github.com/ah508/dragon_optimizer.
